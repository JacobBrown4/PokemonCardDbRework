This is the GitHub Repository for the PokemonCardDatabase that our group developed while using Agile. 
The team that worked on this consisted of Jason Adams, Jon Tague, and Meaghan Ziegler. 
The planning for this App consisted of in depth conversation of what we wanted to create, how we wanted the App to work, and what additional features we wanted this application to have.
Once the discussion was completed, we assigned a table to each of us and then we each created a new branch for us to set out on our on coding paths.
Jason Adams was tasked with the Ownership table, Jon Tauge was tasked with the Set table, and Meaghan Ziegler was tasked with the Card table.
Once the tasks were complete, after the many hardships, stress, and tears, we all merged our branches back onto develop.
Once all three completed tables were merged onto develop, we then did some more testing.
It was at this point where we faced the most hardships. There was anger... There was tears... There was frustration...
Once the God(s) above graced us with compassion and blessings....and Justin Scroggins... we were able to complete the testing and merge the develop branch onto the master.

Listen I'm gonna be honest with you, in the begining of the project, it looked like we could possibly finish everything with ease including our stretch goals. 
But as time went on...look we are blessed to have finished our MVP's...

As for the code itself, it's a Web Api that allows users to create different pokemon cards, sets, and owners for a database. 
The user can enter specific properties for each table and then the Api does this fancy thing where it stores that information into tables within the database.
We also used these fancy things called Foreign Keys so that an owner could be tied to certain cards and sets we also used them on cards so they could be tied to ceratin sets. (I know SUPER fancy stuff!)
With all this combined, it allows users to see all of the necessary data and allow them to veiw specific sets and cards however they like (we only judge slightly here).
